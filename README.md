# Making It!

### How did we make it from scratch to present state?

1. We made the whole app using MERN Stack.
The design process took 3 days where we tried to make a simple yet efficient design which didn't waste students time and also felt great!

2. Then we got learning stuff.
We(I and Kamakshi) were adept with good knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS. We then watched a crash course video on React which gave us some understanding aboout how things worked in React.  
        
    In the same time Anand got statrted with the backend course provided by the mentors. He also learned a bit about database during that time.  
    
3. Build Process
It took us about 9 days to bring the project to an acceptable state where front end was ready and backend too but it was not connected. It took us 1 day more to connect them together and a lot of help from the mentors

4. Deployment
This was a bit tricky for us. We never deployed anything on the web. So we tagged all the mentors and they helped us deploy it. It took a few iterations to get to that stage and also helped us make some final tweaks to the project.
